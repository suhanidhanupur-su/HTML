<!-- Day 3 – PostgreSQL (JOINS + Revision Concepts)

Q️ When can we apply JOINs?
Answer:
We can apply JOIN in SQL when the following two conditions are satisfied:
Case 1
We must have at least two tables.
Case 2
Both tables must have at least one common column (usually an ID).

Example Tables
📘 studentss table
student_id
student_name
city
1
Rahul
Delhi
2
Anita
Mumbai
3
Vikas
Pune
4
Neha
Bangalore


📕 courses table
course_id
student_id
course_name
101
1
Python
102
1
Django
103
2
Java
104
3
SQL





Expected Combined Result (Using JOIN)
student_id
student_name
city
course_name
1
Rahul
Delhi
Python
1
Rahul
Delhi
Django
2
Anita
Mumbai
Java
3
Vikas
Pune
SQL
4
Neha
Bangalore
NULL


🔹 What is JOIN?
Definition
A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related (common) column.

🔹 LEFT JOIN
Definition
LEFT JOIN returns:
All records from the left table


Matching records from the right table


NULL if no match is found



Code
SELECT
    studentss.student_id,
    studentss.student_name,
    studentss.city,
    courses.course_name
FROM studentss
LEFT JOIN courses
ON studentss.student_id = courses.student_id;


Explanation
Left table → studentss


Right table → courses


Common column → student_id


All students will appear


Neha has no course → shows NULL



🔹 RIGHT JOIN
Definition
RIGHT JOIN returns:
All records from the right table


Matching records from the left table


NULL if no match is found



Code
SELECT
    studentss.student_id,
    studentss.student_name,
    studentss.city,
    courses.course_name
FROM studentss
RIGHT JOIN courses
ON studentss.student_id = courses.student_id;


Explanation
All courses will appear


If a course has no matching student → student columns become NULL


Example: course with student_id = 6



🔹 INNER JOIN
Definition
INNER JOIN returns only matching records from both tables.

Code
SELECT
    studentss.student_id,
    studentss.student_name,
    studentss.city,
    courses.course_name
FROM studentss
INNER JOIN courses
ON studentss.student_id = courses.student_id;



Explanation
Only students who have courses will appear


Neha is excluded (no course)


Course with student_id = 6 is excluded (no student)



🔁 Revision: Students Table (Basic SQL)
Create Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);



Insert Data
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES ('Sharma', 22, 'Python');

INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES
('Amit Kumar', 21, 'Django'),
('Neha Singh', 23, 'PostgreSQL');




Delete Data
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;





🔹 WHERE with OR
Definition
OR is used when any one condition is true.
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE course = 'Python' OR age = 29;



🔹 LIKE Operator (Revision)
Starts with
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';



Ends with
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '%a';


Contains
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '%a';




🔹 ALTER TABLE
Definition
Used to change table structure.
ALTER TABLE students
ADD city VARCHAR(50);




🔹 UPDATE
UPDATE students 
SET city = 'Mohali'
WHERE id = 4;




🔹 Creating Tables Again for JOIN Practice
studentss table
CREATE TABLE studentss (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO studentss VALUES
(1, 'Rahul', 'Delhi'),
(2, 'Anita', 'Mumbai'),
(3, 'Vikas', 'Pune'),
(4, 'Neha', 'Bangalore'),
(5, 'Sharik', 'Pune');



courses table
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO courses VALUES
(101, 1, 'Python'),
(102, 1, 'Django'),
(103, 2, 'Java'),
(104, 3, 'SQL'),
(106, 6, 'C');
